RISC-V Microcontroller Development

Our team is building a RISC-V microcontroller, focusing on the following areas:

    SoC Integration and Programming

    Implementation of Control and Status Registers (CSRs) and Zicsr Extension

    Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLINT)

    Atomic Instructions / C Extensions

    Exception Handling

This project involves iterative development of the microarchitecture to ensure the seamless integration of new features and extensions.
