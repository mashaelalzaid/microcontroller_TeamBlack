RISC-V Microcontroller Development

Our team is building a RISC-V microcontroller, focusing on the following areas:

    SoC Integration and Programming

    Implementation of Control and Status Registers (CSRs) and Zicsr Extension

    Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLINT)

    Atomic Instructions / C Extensions

    Exception Handling

This project involves iterative development of the microarchitecture to ensure the seamless integration of new features and extensions.

***Please Note: This is a team work. We shared our labtops, to fix bugs, shared the codes offline to our fellow members, we also had to re-upload the files, and merge on behalf of other members. This made some members appear less contributing than others. Hence the order of contributors is not a fair representation of true contribution.****
